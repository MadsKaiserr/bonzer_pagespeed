      "consequence": "The H1 tag helps search engines understand the main topic of a page and is considered to be one of the stronger on-page ranking signals. Without it, search engines may struggle to correctly index and rank the content. A missing H1 can also negatively impact accessibility and user experience, potentially leading to lower engagement and search result rankings."
